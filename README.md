# Iris Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Iris dataset**, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.  
It covers data loading, cleaning, visualization, and insights extraction using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  

The main goal is to understand the dataset’s features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and how they differ across the three Iris flower species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed. You will also need the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## 💻 Installation
If you are using **Anaconda**, most dependencies are pre-installed.  
Otherwise, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage

Run the script from the terminal:
python iris_analysis.py

f you are using Anaconda, you can also run it from the Anaconda Prompt.

📊 Features of the Analysis

Load the Iris dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

View basic dataset information and summary statistics.

Create visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, pair plots).

Explore relationships between features and species.

Generate insights about patterns in flower measurements.

📝 Notes

If running in VS Code, ensure that your Python interpreter is set to the same environment where pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are installed.

If pip install doesn’t work, try using conda install inside an Anaconda environment.
